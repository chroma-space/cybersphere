<span class="chroma">CHR&#x03F4MA</span> is an artist group formed in 2010 - a collaborative partnership between artist <a href=“http://www.kategenevieve.com/" target="_blank">Kate Genevieve</a> and technologist <a href=“https://github.com/paulhayes" target="_blank">Paul Hayes </a>.
<br/>
<br/> We explore the flexible relationship between real and imagined worlds with interactive media, performance and experimental narrative.  Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, <span class="chroma">CHR&#x03F4MA</span> projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics.
<br/>
<br/> chroma.space is a space for experimentation in the making. Older projects documented at <a href=“http://archive.chroma.space/" target="_blank">archive.chroma.space</a>
