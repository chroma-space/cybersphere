<span class="chroma">CHR&#x03F4MA</span> is an artist group formed in 2010 - a collaberative partnership between artist Kate Genevieve and technologist Paul Hayes. 
<br/> Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, we explore the flexible relationship between real and imagined worlds with interactive media, performance and experimental narrative. These projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics.
