Insula forms part of Of the Spheres, a sequence of projects interacting with how humans find their place in the cosmos 

http://ofthespheres.com

**Concept**

Insula is a project exploring the human experience of living on earth and below the stars: a night time event for out on the land, a film for a 360 Dome and an experimental Virtual Reality experience and documentation filmed on “spaceship earth”. 

Insula is a virtual reality and mixed reality performance exploring emotional and visceral responses to the climate crisis. Exploring how creative technology can viscerally connect us with living ecosystems, particularly the Pacific islands, the front line of the climate crisis. The project will explore the creative agency of the individual human and the group through Virtual Reality and haptic sensing, storytelling, live events and site specific installations.

Insula questions what role creative technology can play in transmitting our current world story to a global culture.

-360 Video 

The first 360 Dome experience - [Heliosphere](http://ofthespheres.com/heliosphere/)- focused on the journey of the Voyager 1 probe beyond the heliosphere to become the first object in intergalactic space. A space mission that showed large scale technological collaboration capable of achieving ambitious feats and also that creative technology can be used both to gather new data about the universe we are a part of AND to communicate what it is like to live on “spaceship earth”.

The second 360 Dome experience focuses on earth now in 2017: threatened by the real effects of climate change and with a developing space programe. Extracting how the story of Lovelock’s Gaia theory was born at NASA when he was working to discover if there was life on earth and emphasising the star lore of the Pacific islands as we meet this fraught time in human history. 


-Ritual 

The project takes up a sense that technology and media can connect us to what is happening on earth now. development of a physical performance for outdoor locations that incorporates exploring, feeling and sensing nature.

Inspired by the kava ceremony this outside event is designed as a night time performance under the stars. Combining fire and water, projections and hacked technology, food and Vanuatu-style wooden yam structures and a basic system using copper wire to listen to the stars. 

The audience members through connecting with place and their ancestry, through sharing food and journeys through the performance become bridges between heaven and earth.

Ritual plants an imaginative seed and open up embodied memory of participation. With an emphasis on action the project gives the opportunity to .. unfolding science fiction and that their own creative imaginations and capacities are enormously powerful.


- **The Virtual Reality Project**

A contact experience in which the individual is cast as the earth.

The visual and tactile world is also created by natural materials: the weaving of a pandanus mat becomes a key piece of animation, the touch of a fir cone in the hand becomes a key narrative element. At the interaction of art, myth and science, the project explores the viewer’s body itself as a fluid, incredibly subtle sensory probe connecting earth and the heavens.

The virtual reality experience uses the body as the basis of understanding how linked we are to the earth. The viewer explores mythic perception through their own experience: becoming as tall as the heavens and transforming into the earth and cosmos. Not intended to give one particular origin myth but to explore the mythic sense of the relationship between the micro and the macro common to all humans living on the earth and below the stars. Each visual seen is accompanied by touch.  This beautiful experience becomes truly tangible by using haptic illusion techniques that play with the plasticity of subjective multi-sensory awareness. Exploring touch with paintbrushes and wooden drumsticks - using the traditional instruments of painting and rhythm in a very contemporary context.

Within the virtual experience the participant experiences a wild Tempest roaring; the participant feels syncopated drumming up and down her legs. After the virtual experience, the participant is asked to embark on the journey back to the real world by stepping into the present. They are asked to take a a step in the dark and explore the real environment through their senses and continue their mythic journey into the unknown future.

All the natural imagery and sound used in the installation transforms information from real living systems: we use acoustic ecology, 3D photo techniques and data sets from coral ecosystems, glacial change, sea level rise and global temperature change to virtually represent the contemporary climate picture. 

###The Team 

Lead by Kate, the production work will involve remote collaboration with:

*  [Christian Krupa](christiankrupa.net), Animator (UK) 
*  [Toby Gifford](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/academic/t.gifford), Sound artist  (AU)   

A collaborative relationship with the [Leweton Cultural Village](http://leweton.weebly.com/) exploring the role of virtual reality and augmented reality in climate change. 

**Development**

This project opened in September 2015 with [open( system )] (http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/event/open-system/) at the Brighton Digital Festival, a working visit with the Leweton Community in 2016 filming and recording in 360 and showings of development at the [Balance-Unbalance] (http://www.balance-unbalance2016.org/) conference 2016.

###There are 5 phases of work:
 			
1. Set up and initial testing phase involving sandpit with all the partners including Creative R&D & Prototyping
2. Field Work, Live Shoot, Asset Capture followed by technical and aesthetic development and testing phase with various staged tests to gather data from audience members, which influence our user experience.
3. Artistic, Technical & Physical Construction
Complete creation of the virtual and physical elements. Construction of the set for the participants and the projection set-up that projects the multi-sensory interactive performance to the wider audiences.
4. Installation and Exhibition. Specific immersive performances and workshops can be run by the artists during the opening events.

Throughout all stages we will test prototypes on volunteers. The project focuses on the visceral experience of the audience member it demands a user centred approach with live audiences exploring multiple prototypes. Various prototypes will explore an array of alternatives for how participants experience their body avatar melding with and transforming into the landscape using real climate data.




###Technical Equipment

The installation will be built using the Unity3d ( version 5.1 pro ) game engine.
The HTC Vive, virtual reality display. As well as a huge field of view the Vive also provides rotation and positional head tracking, which is used as a control input and also gives users presence in their virtual environment.

We will explore combining a motion tracking suit to create the avatar movement or the Kinect V2, body tracker and 3d depth sensor. We’ll be using the Kinect to create real time depth map of the participants of the installation.

Insula uses unique digital technology to communicate the state of our ecosystems in 2015. In December the COP21 occurred in Paris, and the attention of the world needs to be on the climate for we went over the 2 degrees mark in March 2016.

We believe that questions of mental, social and environmental ecology do not simply inform each other, but depend on each other. As a company <span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> explores the implications creative technology and science have on how we can understand ourselves, communicate and act as humans in our environment. In 2016 the focus of our creative practice is to work with the artistic potentials of games technologies - like VR - to explore creative forms of remote relationship around a planetary perspective.  Working with large-scale data sets that communicate a rich picture of the diverse habitats on earth, we design our “live” VR installations to give participants a means of encountering climate information through touch, immersion and narrative. The work draws on ecological research and scientific research into sensory modalities, empathy and subjectivity. As well as innovating artistic work with VR, our open labs, public events, workshops and research aim to increase public awareness of the potentials creative technologies have for transforming how we sense and receive information about the globe and new potentials for communication, action and participation that they open up.	

Kate Genevieve has developed performances using haptic exploration in Virtual Reality since 2010. Initially, work used immersive video headsets. Today she uses commercially available virtual reality headsets to explore how audience members integrate information from the visual and touch modalities. Drawing on research and art residencies at the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science she is working to make large-scale data visceral and embodied through storytelling and immersive audio-visual experience.

###Additional comments

####Accessibility 						
						
Part of the aim of data transmogrification is that the audience is able to experience it in various forms. For example, a participant who is visually impaired could examine a tangible or auditory representation of the output.


####Touch
Touch will focus on neutral areas: shins / knees, shoulders, arms, hands, the top of the head and the navel. The touch will be non invasive and created by brush strokes and designed with a body practitioner. Audience members who are not comfortable with this experience can simply watch.

System for experiencing 

I have worked with one-on-one performance culture in the UK for five years and gained lots of experience of working to schedule how participants book a place in the experience. From experience of exhibition, in general it works through invigilation: open to visitors who arrive to try, watching the experiences of others whilst they wait their turn. During special outdoor events in which lots of people attend it is best to pre-arrange bookable slots: this allows interested people to sign up and return at a set time.
