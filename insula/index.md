<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> - Kate Genevieve and Paul Hayes - have developed performances using haptic exploration in Virtual Reality since 2010. Initially, our work used immersive video headsets. Today we use the Oculus Rift to explore how audience members integrate information from the visual and touch modalities. Drawing on research and art residencies at the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science we are working to make large-scale data visceral and embodied through storytelling and immersive audio-visual experience.

###The Project

Inspired by Daoist thought and the emphasis on a harmonious reciprocal relationship between heaven and earth, Insula is a unique “live art” installation that explores the origin myths of China through Virtual Reality and haptic sensing. 

The performance is designed for two participants and for viewing by a general audience. One participant puts on a white robe, lies down and puts on an Oculus Rift: she takes the role of the 
receptive earth. Inside the Rift view she explores a virtual world: a first-person experience of the P’an Ku story told in the 3rd century text the Wuyun linian ji 五遠歷年紀 “A Chronicle of the Five Cycles of Time”. Using the Microsoft Kinect and the Leap Motion to sense the movement of the participant’s body, she experiences the avatar’s body becoming as tall as the heavens and transforming into the earth and cosmos. Each visual seen is accompanied by touch.  This beautiful experience becomes truly tangible by using haptic illusion techniques that play with the plasticity of subjective multi-sensory awareness.

The haptic sensation is generated by the other participant. The standing participant puts on a black robe and takes up the role of the playful heavens. His action is guided by projections on thereclining participants costume: these visualisations instruct him where to touch with paintbrushes and wooden drumsticks. These tools repurpose the traditional instruments of painting and rhythm.

The installation performs the counterpoised energies of the active and receptive that permeate Chinese philosophy. The standing participant becomes an active haptic performer, and yet always receptive to the guidance of the visual projections that he follows like a visual score. The creative receptivity of the reclining participant is emphasised through amplification of her heart beat, that transforms the rhythm of her pulse as she responds to the immersive experience into the sonic and visual elements of the performance.

All the natural imagery and sound used in the installation transforms information from real living systems: we use acoustic ecology, 3D photo techniques and data sets from coral ecosystems, glacial change, sea level rise and global temperature change to virtually represent the contemporary climate picture. A wider audience can witness the installation through a unique projection: a virtual projection of a birds-eye-view of the supine participant in the Rift and the projections on her body. For the visitors to the gallery the VR installation becomes a unique climate visualisation: a mappa mundi for contemporary times. Insula questions what role creative technology can play in transmitting a myth for a global culture.


Experience In Detail

The installation requires two participants ( a and b ) who are familiar with each other. Both participants put on wireless headphones, which initially guides them through setting up. They both wear a robe, participant (a) has a smock with a white front and is loose fitting, this functions as both a projection screen, and makes the topology of their body more terrain like. Participant (b) has a black smock to help distinguish them in the kinect data so they can be masked out. Participant (a) wears the Oculus Rift and assumes a sitting position in the center of the installation floor, and participant (b) sits to participant (a) right facing them. Once the kinect has identified they are in the right position the installation begins.

Description of the experience: receptive participant

Immersed in the Oculus Rift: all visuals created from natural imagery and climate data. Heart beat sensor effects the projections.

The narrative:

P’an Ku story through Virtual Reality: a proto-being whose body became the earth and cosmos.
Centuries after P’an Ku’s death, the earth and heavens fall out of harmony. The participant is asked to step into the character of the female Nüwa, said to have healed the hole in the sky and restored harmony.

P’an Ku section: the body becomes an ecosystem as imagery is accompanied by touch.

The installation begins playing a runtime rendered 3d scene in the oculus rift involving the cosmos starting as an egg and participant (a) being the giant within the egg. They participant then has to break the egg open and separate the earth and the sky using their arms, which is detected by the kinect or leap motion. While this is happening participant (b) is witnessing prerendered animation projected on participant (a).

The next sequence involves participant (a) lying back, with their head slightly raised by a moulded cushion on the floor. This enables them to be at a correct angle to see their body, while still being in an almost horizontal position. We then use the depth data from the kinect to generate a mesh topology and from that a dynamic terrain of the island, including geological texturing, flora and fauna. This is kept up to date with the participants current body position, easing the heightmap of the terrain, re-texturing and adjusting the height of flora to match. While this is happening participant (b) is guided via audio and the projection to touch participant (a) at various places to simulate meteorological and cosmological events, as well as the movement and changes of life on the island.

Within the virtual experience participant (a) feels a mountain grow out of their navel, as they feel a paint brush circle their tummy. Through the Rift a wild Tempest roars; the participant feels syncopated drumming up and down her legs. 


The Nüwa sequence:

The final sequence involves participant (a) choosing to sit up and use their hands to repair the cosmic destruction that they are seeing in the virtual reality. 

The participant is asked to sit up and perform actions that paint the sky various colours. Integrating simple chi gong movements, participants are guided by 3D visualisations of colourful spheres to move their arms around the outline of these spheres. They perform a series of qigong exercises with their hands, which are read using the leap motion to produce a rich visual experience.

To end:
The participant is asked to embark on the journey back to the real world by stepping into the present. They are asked to take a a step in the dark and continue their mythic journey into the unknown future remembering always that they mediate the harmony of heaven and earth through their body.

Once this is done, participant (b) is instructed to remove participant (a) Oculus Rift and both of their headsets.


Description of the experience: active participant 

Playful tactile experience: 

The participant sees environmental projections on participant a ’s body: through headphones receives audio prompts about how to create tactile responses to these visualisations. The participant responds to environmental projections, painting on the canvas of the reclining participants body. Active and playful they improvise to this visual score projected on the body. 

The two participants switch roles at the end to experience the opposite experience.

Technical Kit

The installation will be built using the Unity3d ( version 5.1 pro ) game engine.
Oculus Rift, virtual reality display. As well as a huge field of view the oculus also provides rotation and positional head tracking, which is used as a control input and also gives users presence in their virtual environment.

Leap Motion, hand tracking device. Originally designed as a gesture interface for traditional desktop computing, Leap have moved their attention to providing the best device for hand tracking in VR and have released an Oculus Rift compatible library for Unity.

Kinect V2, body tracker and 3d depth sensor. We’ll be using the Kinect to create real time depth map of the participants of the installation.

Short throw projector, to render a projection mapping of the island on the body of the participant.

Pepper's Ghost Illusion. Using a lightweight mylar mirror angled at 45 degrees downward, and by 
having the audience ground level approximately 1.75m above the participants, it’s possible to create a virtual projection of participant (a) seemingly hovering just above the ground and directly facing the audience. This allows the audience to witness the projected island from an aerial view like a human data visualisation.

Additional comments:

Accessibility 						
						
Part of the aim of data transmogrification is that the audience is able to experience it in various forms. For example, a participant who is visually impaired could examine a tangible or auditory representation of the output.

Touch:
Our system for ensuring that the touch is consensual is built around creating the performance for two people at a time. Participants come with someone they trust and the performance is an exploration of friendship. 

Age Limit

Age limits to be defined with the gallery and researchers. O
ur feeling as a company is that VR has powerfully embodied effects and that although the content is suitable, we are not looking to exhibit this to anyone under 13.

Costume: 
The robe covers all of the body like a dressing gown on top of clothes. Touch will focus on neutral areas: shins / knees, shoulders, arms, hands, the top of the head and the navel. The touch will be non invasive and created by brush strokes and designed with a body practitioner. Audience members who are not comfortable with this experience can simply watch the projection.
System for experiencing 

We have worked with the one on one performance culture in the UK for five years so have gained lots of experience of working with different galleries to put in place the most simple system for organising how participants try the experience. From our experience of exhibition, in general it works through invigilation: open to gallery visitors who arrive. During private views and special events in which lots of people arrive at the gallery it is best done through bookable slots.



“Questions of mental, social and environmental ecology do not 
simply inform each other, but depend on each other: as anthropologist Gregory Bateson argues "the unit of survival is the organism plus environment. We are learning by bitter experience that the organism which destroys its environment destroys itself.”

CHROMA 

CHROMA is a media art group that creates public and participatory events that challenge assumptions about the interface between the physical and the virtual, real and imagined worlds. Our projects use performance together with immersive and interactive technologies, so that the audience’s perception, bodies and movement become a vital part of the action.
						
Recent projects have shown at the Brighton Dome, London’s Science Museum, Brighton Digital Festival, SCANZ 2013, Oxford’s Light Night, and FACT Liverpool. Our work collaborates across disciplines and brings in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience. We have a strong track record in creating Virtual Reality (VR) performances (see additional information). 
				
As a company CHROMA explore the implications creative technology and science have on how we understand ourselves as humans in our environment. In 2015 the focus of our creative practice is to work with the artistic potentials of games technologies like VR: exploring new forms of relationship, participation and performance.  Working with large-scale data sets that communicate a rich picture of the diverse habitats on earth, we are excited for our VR “live art” installations to give participants a means of encountering climate information through touch, immersion and narrative. As well as innovating artistic work with VR, our open labs, public events, workshops and research aim to increase public awareness of the potentials creative technologies have for transforming how we sense, communicate and receive information about the globe. 
Insula uses unique digital technology to communicate the state of our ecosystems in 2015. In December the COP21 runs in Paris, this key climate meeting will mean that there will be attention on the climate question from around the globe.

###The Team 

The work involves remote collaboration with:
Animator Christian Krupa (UK) 
Sound artist Vjeran Salamon (Croatia)   

We are working with advisors from Liverpool University:
Dr Haekyung Um http://www.liv.ac.uk/music/staff/haekyung-um/ 
Dr Stephanie Donald http://www.stephaniedonald.info/researchinterests.php. 

###There are 5 phases of work:
 			
1. Set up and initial testing phase involving sandpit with all the partners including Creative R&D & 
Prototyping
2. Field Work, Live Shoot, Asset Capture followed by technical and aesthetic development and testing phase with various staged tests to gather data from audience members, which influence our user experience.
3. Artistic, Technical & Physical Construction
Complete creation of the virtual and physical elements. Construction of the set for the participants and the projection set-up that projects the multi-sensory interactive performance to the wider audiences.
4. Installation and Exhibition. Specific immersive performances and workshops can be run by the artists during the opening events.

Throughout all stages we will test prototypes on volunteers. The project focuses on the visceral experience of the audience member it demands a user centred approach with live audiences exploring multiple prototypes. Various prototypes will explore an array of alternatives for how participants experience their body avatar melding with and transforming into the landscape using real climate data.
