> "Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things." - Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching: Chapter 13

> "In a wider sense, humans and nature share the same body. This allows humans to free themselves from the constraints of individuality and meditatively fuse with the greater body of the universe.

<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> - Kate Genevieve and Paul Hayes - have developed performances using haptic exploration in Virtual Reality since 2010. Initially, our work used immersive video headsets. Today we use the Oculus Rift to explore how audience members integrate information from the visual and touch modalities. Drawing on research and art residencies at the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science we are working to make large-scale data visceral and embodied through storytelling and immersive audio-visual experience.
