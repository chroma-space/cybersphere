<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> creatively investigates the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined ones. Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics. Work shows in theatre settings, art galleries, outdoors and unusual site-specific installations. Projects combine performance and narrative together with immersive and interactive technologies: the audience’s perception, bodies and movement are vital to the action.
