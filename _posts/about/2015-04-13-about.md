<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> is an artist's group creatively investigating the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined ones. Our projects take place in theatre settings and art galleries as well as outdoors and unusual site-specific installations. We combine performance and narrative together with immersive and interactive technologies, so that the audience’s perception, bodies and movement become a vital part of the action.

As a company we are exploring the implications technology and science have on how we understand ourselves as humans in the ecosphere. Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, our projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics.
