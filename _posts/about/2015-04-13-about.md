<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> is an evolving entity creatively investigating the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined ones. Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics. Creative play takes place in theatre settings and art galleries as well as outdoors and unusual site-specific installations. Projects combine performance and narrative together with immersive and interactive technologies: the audience’s perception, bodies and movement are vital to the action.
