<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> was founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/kategenevieve" target="_blank" class="green" >Kate Genevieve</a> in 2010 and has been mutating ever since. Work shows in theatre settings, art galleries, outdoors and unusual site-specific installations. Recent projects have shown at the Brighton Dome, London’s Science Museum, Brighton Digital Festival, SCANZ 2013, Oxford’s Light Night, and FACT Liverpool. As well as making, <span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> runs open labs and research, public events and workshops on the potentials that improvisation, creative technologies and open source culture have for transforming how we sense, communicate and receive information about the earth.
