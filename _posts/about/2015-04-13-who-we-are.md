<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> was formed to creatively explore and question the implications technology and science have on how we understand ourselves as humans in the ecosphere. <span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> was founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/kategenevieve" target="_blank" class="green" >Kate Genevieve</a> in 2010 and has been mutating ever since. Recent projects have shown at the Brighton Dome, London’s Science Museum, Brighton Digital Festival, SCANZ 2013, Oxford’s Light Night, and FACT Liverpool. As well as making projects, <span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> runs open labs and research, public events and workshops on the potentials that creative technologies have for transforming how we sense, communicate and receive information about the earth.
