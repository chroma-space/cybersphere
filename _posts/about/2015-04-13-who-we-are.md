<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> was formed to creatively explore and question the implications technology and science have on how we understand ourselves as humans in the ecosphere. Our projects explore the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined ones. The work brings experimental performance together with immersive and interactive technologies, so that the audience’s perception, bodies and movement become a vital part of the action. Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, <span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics.

<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> was founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/kategenevieve" target="_blank" class="green" >Kate Genevieve</a> in 2010 and has been mutating ever since. Working with diverse collaborators, technical direction from [Paul Hayes](https://github.com/paulhayes "green"), and spawning an offshoot - [<span class="chroma">CHRΘMA</span> and Stillpoint](http://feelingsensing.tumblr.com/ "green") - to explore sensing and performance technologies with artist [Rachel Blackman](http://stillpointtheatre.co.uk/ "green"). Recent projects have shown at the Brighton Dome, London’s Science Museum, Brighton Digital Festival, SCANZ 2013, Oxford’s Light Night, and FACT Liverpool. As well as making projects, we host open labs, public events and workshops on the potentials that creative technologies have for transforming how we sense, communicate and receive information about the earth.
