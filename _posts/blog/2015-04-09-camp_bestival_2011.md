<b>C H R Θ M A</b> created a 10 minute animation for projection on Lulworth Castle for Camp Bestival 2011. Inspired by the Medieval theme of the festival, we collaborated with Two Tigers Fireworks and Brightonart, who synchronised fireworks to the animated narrative and precisely mapped and projected the animation onto the front of Lulworth castle.  This Son et lumière finale for Camp Bestival 2011 played to a crowd of 20,000.
