> _“…there is no inner man, man is in the world, and only in the world does he know himself.” Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception (Preface, 1945)_

Of The Spheres is an immersive art project inspired by the journey of NASA’s Voyager 1 probe: a series of outdoor performances that explore how we human beings view their relation to the cosmos and a website for media ecology that collects spheres www.ofthespheres.com 

On the 12th September 2013 NASA announced that the Voyager 1 probe is the first manmade object to enter interstellar space. Whilst this historic transition is taking place at the very outer limits of our solar system, Of the Spheres looks at the reach of technological communication and the perspectives on the earth that the Voyager probes give us.

Heliosphere, the first phase of the Of The Spheres project, is a 360º Sound & Vision performance for a projection dome that was staged as part of Brighton Fringe. To create the show we used data from Voyager's camera, electromagnetic and plasma wave instrumentation, and mixed this with the contents of the record from earth that it carries. 

The second project is an Oculus Rift project called Conjunction made for the UK’s solar eclipse of March 2015 - this project has a separate project post here > 

Exploring using new technologies to record human life on this planet and drawing on the growing field of Acoustic Ecology we are interested in using 360º Photo Spheres and sound recordings as a way of using media to explore the relationship between human beings and their environment. We have a call out for panoramas from around the world exploring places that people identify as “home” > http://ofthespheres.com/share-your-sphere/

Through exploring listening beyond our own spheres of existence and looking beyond our bubbles of personal experience can immersive media experiences put us in contact with how the globe is experienced by different people?  Using techniques of re-mixing the the micro and the macro - life on earth and the sounds and visions NASA is collecting of the cosmos - we’re exploring making visible alternative perspectives of earth and different ways of relating to the ecosphere.
