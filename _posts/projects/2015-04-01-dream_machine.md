Commissioned for Brighton’s White Night Festival 2010 and directed by Sarah Bird, Kate Genevieve and Abbie Stanton the narrative culminated in an animation projection event that lit up the Georgian mansion, Marlborough House, in Central Brighton. This is not a C H R Θ M A project, it was created for the BANG network, but it was created at C H R Θ M A’s inception in October 2010 and so much of what we learnt with this ambitious multi-platform narrative experiment was essential to our early days.

Dream Machine is an experiment in group storytelling and featured the work of over 50 artists and animators: a story of sleep experimentation and imagination told through comics, live performance, radio broadcast and twitter. The Dream Machine story was introduced through the month of October in two comics newspapers (printed by Newspaper Club) that told an alternative history of Marlborough House. Animation projections provided the culmination of this story on the 30th October. We put out an open call through the BANG network for animators and filmmakers to vision the dreams of the sleepers inside the building breaking out onto Brighton's streets. The performance saw octopus tentacles smashing through windows and intricate generative visions.

 Witnessed by a couple of thousand people, the animation played on a rolling programme from 7pm to 3am and each showing finished with a live performance from Brighton University dance students coming out of the building. Seb Lee Delisle created an interactive projection which took the dreams of festival goers that were texted and tweeted to us on the night – and inscribed them onto the mansion between performances. Seb has blogged about these interactive projections.
