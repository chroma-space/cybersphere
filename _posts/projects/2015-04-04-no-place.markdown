Participant's are led on a mixed-reality tour through through the 11-storey Modernist residential building. Live performance is combined with film, animation and virtual environments encountered through video headsets. Immersive visuals, multi-sensory effects and binaural soundscapes play with the participants’ sense of their own bodies, explores the architecture of subjective experience and questions how we feel a place to be REAL. - please blur this

The performance was installed inside Brighton’s Modernist apartment block Embassy Court in October 2011. Development of the project engages with contemporary research into conscious presence in collaboration with the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science at the University of Sussex.
