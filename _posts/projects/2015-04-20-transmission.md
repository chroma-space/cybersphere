Transmission is an installation that invites two strangers into a communication across a large 2-way mirror structure. Participants listen via headphones to a ten minute instruction based narrative that draws them into a relationship via gesture, mirroring and eye contact. The relationship is not gender, age or language dependent and is never exactly the same between any two people.

We are further developing this project with the Nightingale Brighton with the aim of creating a trans-lingual, touring artwork that draws audiences into intimate and creative interactions with each other and environments that lie beyond the margins of consciousness. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience research on empathy responses, an immersive sound design, responsive digital technology, an evocative animated projection and with human connection as its axis point, Transmission is designed as heightened ritual experience of the present moment in the digital age.

CHRΘMA & Stillpoint is the collaboration of Rachel Blackman and Kate Genevieve. We create cross platform works that employ performance, digital technologies and non-verbal vocabularies, to engage a “playing audience” in the potential of their own creative agency.
