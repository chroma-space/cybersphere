> No man is an island / Entire of itself

1John Donne

> ...the unit of survival is the organism plus environment. We are learning by bitter experience that the organism which destroys its environment destroys itself.

Gregory Bateson

> In a wider sense, humans and nature share the same body. 

Chen Xia and Martin Schönfeld, “A Daoist response to climate change,” in the Journal of Global Ethics, August 2011, 202

> Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.

Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching: Chapter 13

Inspired by ecological thinking and the emphasis on a harmonious reciprocal relationship between heaven and earth found in Daoism, Insula is a creative project exploring emotional and visceral responses to the climate crisis. 

We believe that questions of mental, social and environmental ecology do not simply inform each other, but depend on each other. How can creative technology viscerally connect us with the living ecosystems out beyond the city?

This project opened in September with [open( system )](http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/event/open-system/). Over the next year the project will explore the creative agency of the individual human and the group and our connection to the wider ecosystem through Virtual Reality and haptic sensing, storytelling, live events and site specific installations.
