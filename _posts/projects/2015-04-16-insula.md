> Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.

Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching: Chapter 13

> In a wider sense, humans and nature share the same body. This allows humans to free themselves from the constraints of individuality and meditatively fuse with the greater body of the universe. Honing the relationship between human vitality and the pulse of the cosmos is a Daoist contemplative practice. 

Chen Xia and Martin Schönfeld, “A Daoist response to climate change,” in the Journal of Global Ethics, August 2011, 202

Inspired by Daoist thought and the emphasis on a harmonious reciprocal relationship between heaven and earth, Insula is a unique “live art” installation that explores the origin myths of China through Virtual Reality and haptic sensing.
