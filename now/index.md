<span class="chroma">CHRϴMA</span> are opening the doors on the development of their latest Virtual Reality project. We are asking how virtual reality and network technology can bring our domestic spaces into new communications with other living beings and the ecosystem. You are invited to visit and explore work in progress, creatively input and radically speculate about collective territories and future uses for Virtual Reality.



We believe that questions of mental, social and environmental ecology do not simply inform each other, but depend on each other. Anthropologist Gregory Bateson writes that “the unit of survival is the organism plus environment. We are learning by bitter experience that the organism which destroys its environment destroys itself.” Over the last year we’ve been spending time focussing on how creative technology might be able to viscerally connect us with the threatened ecosystem out beyond the city.  Our work with altered and transformed sensing looks at the potentials of Virtual Reality for shifting perception, activating imaginations and revealing connections between our sense of the environment and our understanding of human subjectivity.

<span class="chroma">CHRϴMA</span> is an artist’s group that creates public and participatory events that explore the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual, the real world and imagined ones. Kate Genevieve is an artist, director and researcher working on a DPhil at the University of Sussex, creating virtual reality experiences to explore the plasticity of subjective perception and embodiment. Paul Hayes is a creative programmer, artist and game maker. Paul is committed to exploring the potentials of creative thinking and programming and mentors young people at events like Coder Dojo and Brighton’s Maker club. As a company we investigate the implications technology and science have on how we understand ourselves as humans in the ecosphere. Inspired by cybernetics and ecological thinking, our projects collaborate across disciplines, bringing in diverse perspectives from dance to architecture, magic to neuroscience, anthropology to physics.
