During Onca Network's Festival of Climate Ideas, we are initiating a new project – C A S C A D E

C A S C A D E is an experiment in creative activism & storytelling - created across many different media streams by many different people - imagining into alternative futures for the human race on earth at this time. We’ll be in the gallery growing the project until December 4th and then in Paris during the COP21 - open invitation to come create in situ around different ways of living, working & being together. December 2nd opening night is followed by a screening of Naomi Klein's This Changes Everything from the Brighton Radical Film Festival.

Between Worlds @ [The Spire](http://thespirearts.org/)

Live event exploring non-verbal communication: how we perceive and receive across space without words using sound, touch, feeling, light, symbols. We - Louis D'aboville, Rachel Blackman, Kate Genevieve - are interested in the possibilities of empathy and technology for ecology, activism and playful creativity. This night includes a sound ritual from Isobel Anderson, a fibre optic installation from Maf'j Alvarez, data projections from Kate Genevieve and Simon Wibberley and a Virtual Reality experience from Dr Keisuke Suzuki. There will be Sufi dance, live drawing from scribe-of-the-unconscious Will Scobie, music from Tom Beaufoy (Evil 9) and a chance to share an intimate moment with a stranger across the dark side of a mirror in Chroma and Stillpoint's Transmission. 

The evening begins with a fire ritual at 5pm where we offer you a chance to let go of something that no longer serves your life. Have something ready to burn.

C H R Θ M A are opening the doors on their Virtual Reality development. We are exploring how virtual reality and network technology can dive deep into “shared experience.” Our current focus is on how creative technology might viscerally connect us with the ecosystem out beyond the city. We believe that questions of mental, social and environmental ecology do not simply inform each other, but depend on each other. Anthropologist Gregory Bateson writes that “the unit of survival is the organism plus environment. We are learning by bitter experience that the organism which destroys its environment destroys itself.”

You are invited to visit and explore work in progress, creatively input and imagine alternative collective territories and future uses for Virtual Reality. It's not a show - we're just opening the doors on where we are and welcoming you into it.
